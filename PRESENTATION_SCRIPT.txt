# GlobeTrotter - Presentation Script

Here is a breakdown of talking points for each of the three team members.

---

### Person 1: Backend & Architecture Lead

**Focus:** The robust foundation and core backend logic.

**Talking Points:**

"Good morning/afternoon. I was responsible for the overall system architecture and backend development. Our primary goal was to build a scalable and maintainable application, following professional industry standards.

1.  **Architecture:** We chose a **decoupled monorepo architecture**. This means our backend and frontend are separate applications that communicate via a REST API. This separation of concerns is crucial for scalability and allows our team to work on the frontend and backend simultaneously without conflicts.

2.  **Backend Technology:** We built a **custom backend using Node.js and Express.js with TypeScript**. We deliberately avoided "Backend-as-a-Service" platforms like Supabase because we wanted to demonstrate our strong grasp of core backend principles, which we knew was a key judging criterion.

3.  **Database:** For our database, we are using **PostgreSQL, running in a Docker container**. This ensures a consistent and isolated development environment for every team member. I designed the relational database schema from the ground up, establishing the critical relationships between Users, Trips, Cities, and Activities. We are using **Prisma as our ORM** for type-safe and efficient database queries.

4.  **Authentication:** I implemented a **custom, token-based authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)**. When a user registers, we securely hash their password using `bcrypt` before storing it. Upon login, we verify their credentials and issue a signed JWT. This token is then used to authorize all subsequent API requests, ensuring that users can only access their own data. This entire authentication flow is built from scratch."

### Person 2: Frontend Lead

**Focus:** The modern, user-centric frontend and component design.

**Talking Points:**

"Hello, I led the development of our frontend. My focus was on creating a clean, responsive, and intuitive user experience using a modern tech stack.

1.  **Frontend Technology:** We are using **Next.js with the App Router and TypeScript**. This provides a fantastic developer experience and allows us to build a high-performance application with features like server-side rendering.

2.  **UI/UX:** For our user interface, we chose **Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI**. This combination allows us to rapidly build beautiful, accessible, and consistent components. It gives us the flexibility of a utility-first CSS framework while providing a solid foundation of unstyled components to build upon.

3.  **Component-Based Architecture:** I've structured our entire UI around reusable components. A key example is our **`AuthForm` component**, which handles both user registration and login. This approach keeps our code DRY—Don't Repeat Yourself—and makes our codebase much easier to maintain and scale.

4.  **What We've Built:** So far, I have built the core user-facing pages that are essential for the application to function. This includes:
    *   A fully styled **Signup page** (`/signup`).
    *   A matching **Login page** (`/login`).
    *   And most importantly, a **Dashboard page** (`/dashboard`) which serves as the user's home base after logging in. For this review, the dashboard is populated with mock data to clearly demonstrate the intended user experience and layout for managing upcoming trips."

### Person 3: Project Manager & Next Steps

**Focus:** The current project status, challenges, and the clear path forward.

**Talking Points:**

"Hi everyone. I've been managing the project workflow and ensuring we are on track to meet our goals. I'll summarize where we stand and what our immediate next steps are.

1.  **Current Status:** As my teammates have outlined, we have successfully built the foundational pillars of our application. The database is live, the core backend API for authentication is complete, and we have a functional and visually appealing frontend for user onboarding and the main dashboard.

2.  **Challenges & Solutions:** Our biggest challenge has been a persistent issue with our custom backend server crashing under load. We believe in transparency, and while we've spent time debugging this, we've made the strategic decision for this review to focus on what we *can* present: a solid frontend and a well-designed architecture. Our immediate next step is to resolve this server instability. We have already implemented enhanced logging to pinpoint the root cause.

3.  **Immediate Next Steps:** Our plan for the next few hours is clear and actionable:
    *   **First:** We will use our new logs to diagnose and **fix the server instability**.
    *   **Second:** We will connect the frontend login and signup forms to our now-stable backend API to enable full end-to-end user authentication.
    *   **Third:** We will replace the mock data on the dashboard with live data by fetching trips from our authenticated `/api/v1/trips` endpoint.

In summary, we have a very strong foundation in place and a clear, strategic plan to deliver a fully functional prototype. Thank you."
