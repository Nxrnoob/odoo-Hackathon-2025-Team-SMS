##  Selected Problem Statement

> **Problem Title:** *GlobeTrotter – Empowering
Personalized Travel Planning*  
> **Problem Description:** *The overarching vision for GlobeTrotter is to become a personalized,
intelligent, and collaborative platform that transforms the way individuals
plan and experience travel. The platform aims to empower users to
dream, design, and organize trips with ease by offering an end-to-end
travel planning tool that combines flexibility and interactivity.
It envisions a world where users can explore global destinations, visualize
their journeys through structured itineraries, make cost-effective
decisions, and share their travel plans within a community—making
travel planning as exciting as the trip itself.*

**Proposed Solution:**  
Design and develop a complete travel planning application where
users can:
    Create customized multi-city itineraries
    Assign travel dates, activities, and budgets
    Discover activities and destinations through search
    Receive cost breakdowns and visual calendars
    Share their plans publicly or with friends.
